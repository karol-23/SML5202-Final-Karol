<h2> Why study a language with us?</h2>

<p> <i> At [website name] we believe that in the face of globalisation and advanced technology, it is becoming more and more imperative to understand one or more languages. Not only does it increase job prospects but it also broadens your social horizons. The language learning process is full of surprises. One might not expect it but learning a language is not just about grammar rules and how good your pronounciation is. It is also about the country's history, the culture, the gastronomy and it's people. </i> </p>
